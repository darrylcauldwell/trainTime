LiveRail – the smartest way to track live train departures across the UK. Search by route, not just station, and see only the trains that actually matter to your journey.

JUST YOUR TRAINS, NOTHING ELSE

Ever stood at a station squinting at the board, trying to spot YOUR train among forty others? We fixed that. Pick your origin and destination – you only see direct services. No clutter, no confusion.

ALTERNATIVE ROUTES

When a train is cancelled, one tap shows you other services still running on the same route – so you can get moving rather than staring at a red board.

CONNECTING JOURNEYS

When there’s no direct service, LiveRail automatically searches for connecting journeys across National Rail, with full leg-by-leg breakdowns showing each train, platform, and connection time.

GET HOME

Set your home station once. Whenever you need it, tap ‘Get Me Home’ and LiveRail uses your location to find your nearest stations and show available trains home. In London, it also shows TfL transit directions to get you to the right platform.

CARPLAY

View live departures for your saved route on your car’s display, hands-free. On-time, delayed with expected departure time, and cancelled services are all shown at a glance – so you know whether to rush or take your time.

OFFLINE SUPPORT

Lost signal underground? LiveRail caches your recent departure boards. You’ll always see a timestamp so you know when the data is from – no silent failures, no blank screens.

SAVED & RECENT ROUTES

Save your favourite journeys for one-tap access. LiveRail also remembers your 15 most recent routes, with the option to pin the ones you use daily.
